## Learning Notes

#### Building
- The layout of the page was built first with HTML and CSS, replicating the coolers app

#### The javascript:
- starting with the functions to generate random colours
  - created an object, learning about object orientated programming in the process
  - HEX or RBG values - generated random Hex colours - is one better or worse?
- functions to lock a colour in place
- functions to replace one colour at a time

#### How can I Generate related colours rather than random (e.g. ascending lightness, complementary hues etc)? 
There are many theories for creating related palettes including:
- auto
- monochromatic
- split complimentary
- complimentary
- tradic
- tetradic
= Analogous Schemes - An analogous color combination is any 3 adjacent colors on a 12-color wheel -  varying the saturation of your analogous color scheme is important to ensure enough contrast to keep it interesting
